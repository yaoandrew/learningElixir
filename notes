Video4 - Mix is used to create projects, compile projects, run tasks and manage dependencies.
Create a project - mix new [project name]

Video5 - generates project subdirectories. Project name is used to create directory and
creates a module with the same name. Module is a collection of methods or functions. 
Run code by typing iex -S mix
parens after method calls are optional. methods have implicit return like ruby.

Video6 - create a method to generate list of cards. Use [] notation for creating array.
Within iex - use recompile(). Create deck and test method.

Video7 - In OO style, we would have a deck class, that creates an instance with a collection 
of cards and methods to access or modify that collection of cards. In a FP approach, we would
have a Cards Module.
